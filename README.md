# Fertilizer-Recommendation-System
In modern agriculture, efficient and accurate fertilizer recommendation is crucial to ensure high crop productivity while maintaining soil health. This project develops a Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning to recommend the most suitable fertilizer based on soil nutrients, environmental conditions, and crop type. A supervised learning approach is applied to a real-world dataset, and the model is trained to predict the ideal fertilizer by analyzing soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, moisture, and crop type. This system aims to support farmers in making data-driven decisions that reduce costs, prevent over-fertilization, and promote sustainable agriculture.
